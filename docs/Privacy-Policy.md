# **Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date:** April 21, 2025

## **Introduction**

Welcome to **XCamScreen**. We are committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining full transparency regarding how your information is handled. XCamScreen is a **fully offline desktop camera and screen recording application**, built with **Qt C++**, designed for users who want to capture webcam, screen, and PiP (Picture-in-Picture) recordings — without any form of internet transmission, cloud storage, or data tracking.

## **What Data We Collect**

**XCamScreen does not collect, transmit, or share any personal or device data.**
All data generated through the application remains **locally on your computer**.
Examples of data that may be generated and saved locally include:

* Recorded videos
* Captured photos
* Application configuration settings (e.g., selected resolution/FPS/mic/camera options — stored only for user convenience)

XCamScreen does **not store**, **read**, or **access**:

* Personal identity information
* Contacts, browsing history, or external computer files
* System logs or hardware identifiers

### 🔒 Local Data Handling Only

* **No cloud uploads**
* **No remote servers**
* **No background data sync**
* **No external storage of user recordings**

The application allows users to specify the destination folder for recordings — files remain under the full control of the user.

## **How We Use and Secure Your Data**

All processing occurs **locally on your device** and is handled only for core functionality, such as:

* Webcam recording
* Screen recording
* Picture-in-Picture (PiP) overlay
* Audio recording when enabled by the user

No data is transmitted externally during any operation.
XCamScreen does not include any code for analytics, advertisements, telemetry, or monitoring.

## **Permissions and Access**

XCamScreen requests access only for features necessary to function:

| Permission            | Purpose                                               |

The application does **not** access:

* Internet or network activity
* GPS / location
* Contacts / messages
* Personal user documents not selected for export

## **Third-Party Services**

XCamScreen does **not integrate with** and does **not send data to**:

* Advertising platforms
* Cloud storage providers
* Analytics or tracking services
* Third-party data processors

The software is completely standalone and offline.

## **Your Rights**

Because all recordings and data are stored locally, **you remain the sole owner of your content.** You may:

* View recordings anytime

* Uninstall the application at any time without involving the developer

No request is required from the developer to access, export, or delete your data.
